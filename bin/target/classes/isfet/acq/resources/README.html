<h1>Instructions for Running RestletInstrument Examples</h1>
<p>
  The purpose of this exercise was to create an interactive environment using the Restlet REST API to interact with an instrument.</br>
  Much of this code was based on, and expanded from code checked in John Krupka for his work using qpid and scxml</br></br>  
  
  The following technologies are used:
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://qpid.apache.org/">Apache QPID</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://commons.apache.org/scxml/">Apache SCXML</a></li>
  </ul>
  
</p>
<p>
    Steps to run:
	<ol>
	   <li>Download QPID and install locally</li>
	   <li>Start the QPID server from ${QPID_HOME}\bin</li>
	   <li>Start TestServer in isfet.acq package by running as Java Application</li>
	   <li>Open up restlet_instrument.html in a browser and starting clicking!</li>
	</ol>
	
</p>
<p>
	Watch any logs for errors.  The QPID log is located in ${QPID_HOME}/work (but you must create this directory first!)</br>
    Watch the console for error messages - you should see JMS messages being sent back and forth to the server.</br>	

</p>

<p>
    The possible order for setting state events is based on the insDm.scxml file. When the instrument is in a certain state, only the events defined for that state can be executed.</br>
    For example, when in the "Running" state, the only events that can be executed are "Run Aborted" or "ICRunCompleted".
